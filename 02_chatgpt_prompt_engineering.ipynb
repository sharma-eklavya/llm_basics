      "  <p>The 555 timer IC features eight pins, each serving a specific purpose. The GND pin (Pin 1) provides the ground reference voltage, ensuring a low level of 0V. Pin 2, known as TRIG, initiates a timing interval when the input falls below 1/2 of the CTRL voltage. The OUT pin (Pin 3) is driven to approximately 1.7V below the positive supply voltage, or to GND. Pin 4, labeled RESET, resets the timing interval when driven to GND, but the timing does not restart until RESET rises above approximately 0.7 volts. The CTRL pin (Pin 5) provides control access to the internal voltage divider. The THR pin (Pin 6) determines the end of the timing interval when its voltage exceeds that at CTRL. Pin 7, known as DIS, is an open collector output that can discharge a capacitor between intervals. Finally, the Vcc pin (Pin 8) supplies the positive voltage to the IC, typically ranging from 3V to 15V.</p>\n",
